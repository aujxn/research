\section{Progress}
This week I didn't make as much progress as I would have liked. This week was busy with my classes and with
midterms coming up I didn't spend as much time as I would like on my project.
I created the ingredient co-occurrence graph and started looking at my data. I tried to apply a 
\href{https://github.com/aujxn/graph-embed/tree/f47f8af147ae88c51bbc013e6c3f17df8eb8133e}{partitioning
algorithm} to my ingredients but all the ingredients cluster into three groups. I installed Zotero and am
in the process of organizing my research and notes. This week I would like to do some more meaningful
analysis and figure out how to use the graph-embed library more effectively.
