\section{Progress}
My primary accomplishment this week was figuring out how to use \href{https://github.com/LLNL/graph-embed/}
{graph-embed} to partition my data and embed it into a 3 dimensional space. I have tested with a couple
different sub sets of my data and have some interesting results. I am definitely having success at
clustering ingredients that show up in recipes together.
\href{web.cecs.pdx.edu/~ajn6/recipe/plot1}{This} and
\href{web.cecs.pdx.edu/~ajn6/recipe/plot2}{this} are a couple of the embeddings that I created with my data.
I still didn't accomplish as much as I would have liked to this week. My course load this term is heavy and
I didn't think I would be as busy as I am. Next week after midterms I hope I have some more time to commit
to working on this.
