   recipe instructions as natural language from a set of ingredients.
   The primary focus is on connecting ingredients with semantic instructions and
   finding ways to connect those instructions into sensible event chains. These event
   chains are then translated into natural language using standard distrobutional 
   naturual language processing techniques such as word2vec and bag of words. Section
   one introduces the motivation and details the research question. The goal is to
   generate recipes utilizing data from aggregated recipes using unsupervised
   learning techniques. Section two gives a history of related work and details the
   inspiration for many of the techniques utilized. Section three describes the
   datasets used. Public datasets of recipes such as OpenRecipes and Now you're
   cooking provide about 200,000 recipes for processing. This section also details
   the general data-wrangling techniques and generalized statistics. Bostan also
   found cuisine can be identified from the ingredients of the recipe. Section four
   details the methods of the study. Botan created two co-occurrence matrices.
   One counting the pairs of co-occurring ingredients and the other counting pairs
   of ingredient - action (ie. stir, bake, whisk) occurrences. To create the
   ingredient vector space, Bostan reduced the dimension of the Ingredient matrix
   using singular value decomposition. This information is used to train an
   architecture or recurrent neural network called a Long-short-term memory network.
   To test the network, Bostan trained on 80\% of the data then tried to generate
   instructions for the remaining recipes. Bostan found promising results but left
   many components to future research.}
